Q.Clone List with Next and Random

ex : Input: head = [[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]] 
     Output: head = [[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]] 
     Explanation: Node 1 points to Node 2 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
                  Node 2 points to Node 3 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
                  Node 3 points to Node 4 as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
                  Node 4 points to NULL as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.

Code :
 Node *cloneLinkedList(Node *head)
    {
        map<Node*,Node*> mp;
        Node* ptr=head;
        while(ptr)
        {
            mp[ptr]=new Node(ptr->data);
            ptr=ptr->next;
        }
        ptr=head;
        while(ptr)
        {
            mp[ptr]->next=mp[ptr->next];
            mp[ptr]->random=mp[ptr->random];
            ptr=ptr->next;
        }
        return mp[head];
    }
