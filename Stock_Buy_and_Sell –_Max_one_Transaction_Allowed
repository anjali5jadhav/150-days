Q.Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed

ex:    Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
      Output: 8
      Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.

code:

int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        
        int n = prices.size();
    
        if (n <= 1) return 0; 

        int minPrice = prices[0];  
        int maxProfit = 0;         

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
